    NAME
    automata - a multiplayer game where cellular automata compete for supremacy. Only 1 automata can be controlled from a single URL. To control more than 1 color yourself connect to the board from another tab.

    WIN CONDITION
    You win when your automata occupies at least
    - 50% of the board (2 players)
    - 30% of the board (3 players)
    - 20% of the board (4 players)

    THE CATCH
    If any 2 different colored automata collide every cell connected to the collision by association dies.

    DESCRIPTION
    The only way to interact with your automata is by defining Survival/Birth (S/B) conditions in the input field beneath the game grid.

    S - consists of a list of numbers, each of which represent how many living neighbors are necessary for a <span class="highlight">living</span> cell to <span class="highlight">survive</span>.
    B - consists of a list of numbers, each of which represent how many living neighbors are necessary for a <span class="highlight">dead</span> cell to be <span class="highlight">born</span>.

    USAGE
    $ /[1-9]*\/[1-9]*/

    EXAMPLES
    $ 124/14
    $ /123
    $ 1356/

    FIG 1.

    0 | 1 | 0
    --+---+--
    0 | c | 1
    --+---+--
    0 | 0 | 1

    If we apply the S/B rule 134/25 to the cell depicted in FIG 1. we see that there are 3 living neighbors.

    We can deduce that if c is living (c=1) then it will survive b/c rule S includes a 3.
    However, if c is dead (c=0) then it will stay dead b/c rule B does not include a 3.
